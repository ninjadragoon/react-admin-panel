# react-admin-panel
A basic structure of an admin panel (SPA)

# Functionalities included: 
1. Application flow from login to dashboard
2. Routing enabled in dashboard
3. Login form validation (very basic) with loading spinner
4. Display success/error/warning toaster notifications
5. A middle method where we can check if user is authenticated/authorized every time a route changes. (Currently checking 'isLoggedIn' boolean in session storage)


# Folder structure:

1. admin dashboard content
Contains a complete bootstrap/jquery based open source admin panel theme. I have taken only necessary parts from it into the react app.

2. login page content
Contains html/css/js/media files of the open source login page. I have taken only necessary code from here too. 
I am not discarding above two folders so that code can be taken from them when required in future. 

3. spa
Contains the react app

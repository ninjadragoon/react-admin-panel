# react-admin-panel
A basic structure of an admin panel (SPA)

Folder structure:

1. admin dashboard content
Contains a complete bootstrap/jquery based open source admin panel theme. I have taken only necessary parts from it into the react app.

2. login page content
Contains html/css/js/media files of the open source login page. I have taken only necessary code from here too. 
I am not discarding above two folders so that code can be taken from them when required in future. 

3. spa
Contains the react app
